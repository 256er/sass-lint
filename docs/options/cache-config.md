# Config File

Option `cache-config` will tell Sass Lint to cache the current configuration for each invocation of sass-lint. This option is enabled by default but you may consider disabling it if you wish to modify your `.sass-lint.yml` file on the fly within the context of an IDE plugin for example.

## Options

* `true`/`false` (defaults to `true`)
